# Design decisions

Choices made while building the base, roster, tower, campaign, mission and Operations work
(prompts 1–6), where the brief left room or where a stand-in is used for now. Newest at the
bottom of each section.

## 1. Bases as a loadout

- **The HQ replaces both camp bastions.** It is one `headquarters` vehicle (9000 hp,
  Structure armour) with the bastion's twin heavy gun, twin 30 mm flak on the roof and a
  coaxial MG. It uses the `command_hq` model for now; a dedicated HQ model comes with the
  tower models in prompt 3.
- **Fortification points, not counts.** Every tower carries `"fort": {"points", "weight"}` in
  balance.json: light 1–2, medium 3, heavy 4–5. HQ levels 1–5 give 6/8/10/12/14 points and
  1/1/2/2/3 utility slots (`base.levels`). All levels are open until the campaign gates them
  (prompt 4).
- **Hardpoints live in the map data** (`bases[].slots`, per team, with a size and a facing). A
  tower goes only into a slot at least as big as its footprint (`max(length, width)`). The
  loadout fills slots front first (nearest the enemy HQ), heaviest towers first.
- **Flying a tower back in.** A destroyed tower's slot can be re-called for
  `ceil(points × cpPerPoint)` CP (`cpPerPoint` 1.0, the brief's 50% × points × 2 CP), 45 s
  after it fell or was last called, landing 4 s later. The HUD shows a rail button only while a
  slot can be called; the commander AI rebuilds the front slot when its army is at least 12 CP
  and it keeps 4 CP spare.
- **Roles by mode** (`base.roles`): Conquest, King of the Hill and Deathmatch are *Anchor*
  (the HQ cannot fall); Assault and Siege are *Target* (the defender's base is the objective,
  the attacker's an anchor); Defend and Endless are *Defend* (losing the HQ loses the battle);
  Survival, Boss Rush and the campaign default to *None*. A campaign mission opts in with
  `playerBase` / `enemyBase`.
- **Fire rule.** Strikes into an enemy home zone stay refused, except on a *Target* or
  *Defend* base (Siege, Assault, marked campaign missions), which can be shelled.
- **Outposts.** A mission marks points with `"outposts"`; the map gives such a point up to two
  `outpost` slots. Once the point is owned, the side can set it up for 6 CP; it then takes
  towers flown in for CP and becomes a secondary drop zone (the most forward one wins). Losing
  the point destroys its towers. Marked for now: m10 Ironport (town) and m14 Jungle Pass (west);
  the new campaign (prompt 4) will mark more.
- **The enemy's loadout** is drawn by `BaseLoadout.ForAi(difficulty, style, seed)`: HQ level
  by difficulty (Easy 2, Normal 3, Hard 5), towers by weighted draw from a style
  (`default`, `armour`, `artillery`, `air`) within the budget, at least one anti-air tower once
  half the budget is spent. The style is the hook for the commander personalities of prompt 4.
- **Tower sense in the AI.** Towers weigh in the odds of going into their reach (1.4× needed);
  the line stops at the edge of their guns until together and strong enough, giving its
  artillery 35 s on them first, or goes in after 70 s if it is at least a match. Flankers and
  crate runners keep out of tower reach. `TacticalAi.TowerSense` can be turned off only to
  measure the difference.
- **Towers kept as they are.** The existing towers carry points now; `point_tower` is kept only
  as a capture-point watchtower and is left out of loadouts (it merges into `guard_tower` in
  prompt 3). `FortDef.Tier` and the utility kind are in place for prompt 3.

## 2. Roster cleanup and balance

- **Merges.** APC → IFV, APS tank → battle tank, Grad → MLRS, howitzer → SP artillery,
  240 mm mortar → siege tank, carpet bombing → airstrike. The merged vehicle defs and the
  carpet bombing support are gone from the catalog; `CardMerges` keeps the old ids so saved
  progress and decks move across. The sky gunship stays in the catalog only as the Gunship
  item's aircraft; it is no longer a card.
- **What the target card took over.** The IFV now takes points 3× as fast and pops smoke when
  hit (the APC's job), and replaces the APC as a starter card. The MBT keeps its stats; APS
  tank owners get an Epic Trophy APS module instead. Elite APC now pairs with the IFV; the
  elite Grad keeps its own model and is paired with the MLRS only for its army cost (the elite
  MLRS stays the MLRS's elite).
- **Save migration** (`PlayerProfile.MigrateRoster`, once per save): the card it became gets the
  unlock, the blueprints and the higher rank; the coins and blueprints spent on the lower rank
  come back (the blueprints as the new card's). A retired card's coins come back and its
  blueprints turn universal. Cards bought with coins that no longer exist (sky gunship 4,500,
  carpet bombing 3,000) are refunded in full. Saved decks swap old ids for the new card.
- **Siege tank stays premium.** Players who had unlocked the 240 mm mortar get the siege tank.
  New players buy it as before. The campaign unlock slots freed by the merges went to the
  new cards (command vehicle m10, wheeled gun and counter-battery radar m11, long-range SAM m13,
  UAV scan m06, field tower m12, remote mines m16, SEAD m15).
- **Early missions get no harder.** In m00–m05 the enemy's APC became an armoured car. Later
  missions use the IFV. The player's placed unit in m02 is an IFV.
- **Shop.** The shop now lists every premium card (siege tank, ballistic launcher and heavy
  attack heli were buyable only from their locked card before).
- **Lancet.** ×2 damage on the artillery class and on vehicles that have stood still 3 s
  (the bonuses never stack). Fixed defences do not count as parked.
- **Iron Beam.** Point defence: 1 interceptor that reloads in 1.2 s, 30 m around it, taking
  missiles, drones and every rocket (artillery rockets too). Measured over 5 seeds, a 4-tank group
  under ATGMs, a Lancet, an MLRS and a helicopter lost 5,528 HP in 30 s with the beam against
  7,136 HP with two AA vehicles (8 CP), with 28 intercepts a minute. It is worth more than 8 CP,
  so it stays at 9 CP.
- **Ka-52.** Vikhr 55 m, and `standoff`: it holds at 60–97 % of that range, on the side of the
  target furthest from any known anti-air it outranges (anti-air that reaches as far is not
  avoided: there is no standing outside it).
- **New vehicles** (HP in data is the in-game figure ÷ 2.5 toughness):
  - Command vehicle: 6 CP, 560 (1,400) HP, light armour, 8 m/s, roof HMG. Friendly vehicles
    within 25 m fire 10 % faster (the best aura counts; auras do not add up). After 5 s standing
    still it is a drop zone, landing deliveries 7 m behind it. One per side; the AI buys it once
    it has 5 vehicles and keeps it with the support group behind the line.
  - Wheeled gun: 7 CP, 440 (1,100) HP, 12 m/s, 105 mm 300 AP / 4.6 s (65 DPS on heavy), 38 m,
    ×1.25 on a side or rear hit (on top of the usual side and rear factors).
  - Counter-battery radar: 5 CP, 360 (900) HP, HMG only. Enemy artillery that fires within
    120 m shows for 8 s, and our artillery does +15 % to it. This reuses the equipment trait's
    reveal status (the better of the two counts when both are present). The AI buys it only
    against enemy guns.
  - Long-range SAM: 11 CP, 440 (1,100) HP, 6 m/s, one 600-damage missile every 8 s, air only,
    95 m, minimum range 20 m, sight 80 m.
  - The models were built for all four and for the HQ (`Tools/blender/mb_phase2.py`), with a
    Blender muzzle check (`check_muzzles.py`). The HQ's flak is listed twice so both barrels fire.
- **Supports:**
  - UAV scan: 2 CP, 45 s. A drone circles the mark and shows everything within 30 m for 10 s,
    stealth, hidden units and mines too.
  - Remote mines: 5 CP, 60 s. 8 mines within 12 m, 600 damage each; they clear after 60 s.
  - Field tower: 6 CP, 90 s. A guard tower, or an ATGM tower from card rank 5, dropped for
    60 s. It is refused in the enemy camp whatever the mode.
  - SEAD: 7 CP, 90 s. 500 HE damage on the enemy air defence nearest the mark within 20 m,
    knocked out 8 s. Air defence is the anti-air class, or a fixed defence with an air-only
    weapon or missile.
  - The commander AI calls:
    - SEAD on known air defence when it flies aircraft or can soon;
    - the field tower on a point it holds with 2+ enemies within 45 m;
    - mines across the way of an enemy group 22+ m from its line;
    - the scan where something unseen is hitting it, or over an objective it is closing on
      with no enemy seen.
- **Airstrike from card rank 7.** The line is 40 % longer with 40 % more bombs (84 m, 11 bombs).
  The rank reaches the sim through `SetBoosts(strikeRank:)`.
- **Balance:**
  - VBIED ×0.5 on structures (a stream of 12 at an HQ with three towers left it untouched).
  - Siege tank 12 CP with ×2.4 on structures, about 155 DPS on them.
  - Tank buster 18 CP.
  - Gunship helicopter 14 CP (the CP option rather than −15 % against heavy armour: one number,
    same effect on value).
  - Stealth bomber 20 CP.
  - Railgun: measured 1.22 vehicles a shot (574 shots over 15 battles), below 2, so it drops to
    9 CP (rather than +25 % damage: a cheaper card suits its long-range, low-DPS role).
- **Supply.** The "24 × 1.05" was the army supply in CP: upkeep starts at 1.5× it, about 37 CP
  (5 mid-tier vehicles). It is now data per mode (`economy.armyCap`, default 40, so about 63 CP
  before upkeep, 8–10 mid-tier vehicles). Modes that set their own (Siege, Defend, campaign
  missions) keep theirs. `TeamEconomy.SupplyBonus` is the hook for the logistics module.
- **Campaign enemy scaling** is data (`economy.enemyScaling`), now 0.55 (was 0.8).
- **Recommended power** on the mission panel is the deck power expected by then. Rank 1 cards
  with no equipment give 100; the campaign climbs to rank 7 by the last mission. Hard missions
  add 6 % and the Heroic and Iron tiers add 8 % and 16 %. The deck's own power is the average
  over its vehicles of √(toughness × firepower).
- **Texts.** The Monolith Plate's line and the module descriptions no longer print raw keys or
  `{1}`. `LocalisationScanTests` checks:
  - both languages carry the same placeholders;
  - every card has a name and a guide entry;
  - all equipment, modules, traits and brands read as words at every rarity.
- **Firing spots are never shared.** A gun used to take another gun's booked firing spot when it was the
  only safe one left (a +1000 penalty, not a ban). Siege tanks (62 m reach) round a fortress have few such
  spots, so two often stood on one (TrafficTests: 66–331 shared bookings per ~1,000 checks on four maps).
  A booked spot is now out; two closer rings (65 % and 55 % of range) are tried when the outer three are all
  exposed or booked, and a gun that finds nothing holds back instead.
  - The price: m13 (the Ember Ridge fortress) is 1/5 (round 6: 2/5). With shared spots allowed it was 3/5,
    and a finer 7.5° bearing search dropped it to 0/5.
  - m13's weakness is the army not breaking into the fortress, and prompt 4 rebuilds that mission as a
    multi-stage grand campaign, so it is left there.
- **m12** has a 20-minute clock (it had none, and a stuck train could keep it open forever). A route boss
  that makes no headway for 12 s is sent on again to its waypoint (the train steered round tanks parked on
  its line and never found it back). Now 5/5.
- **Defend.** The attacking waves get no camp base of their own: an attacker camp is built only when the
  player attacks (Siege).

## 7. Sized slots (the supplementary prompt; replaces fortification points)

- **Why.** With both a slot count and a point budget, the slots were the scarce thing, so each
  was filled with the strongest tower and the light ones were never picked.
- **Slots by size.** Small takes light towers, medium light or medium, large any. HQ levels 1–5
  open 3/1/0, 4/2/0, 4/2/1, 5/3/1 and 6/3/2 (small/medium/large), with 1/1/2/2/3 utility slots.
  Every map camp has 6/3/2 tower slots and 3 utility slots, the most important of each size listed
  first, so a lower level opens the best ones. Outposts have 1 small and 1 medium slot.
- **Tower sizes.**
  - Small: guard tower, MG bunker, AA tower, EW tower, dragon's teeth, minefield.
  - Medium: gun tower, ATGM tower, rocket battery, C-RAM, hidden gun pit.
  - Large: artillery emplacement, Patriot, drone hangar, heavy fortress.
  - A tower's rank-7 branch keeps its size.
- **A loadout is three lists by slot size** (`BaseLoadout.Small/Medium/Large`), not tied to a map:
  the i-th small slot of any camp takes `Small[i]`. `Fitted` keeps only towers that fit a list's
  size and only as many as the level opens.
- **Rebuilding by size.** Small 2 CP / 25 s, medium 4 CP / 40 s, large 7 CP / 60 s (the 4 s
  flight stays).
- **Migration.** A saved point loadout (one list) goes into the level-5 lists largest first: large
  towers into large slots; medium ones into medium, then large; light ones into small, then medium,
  then large. What finds no slot is left out of the loadout: its rank and equipment live on the
  tower's card, so nothing is lost.
- **New profiles** get 6 small (guard, AA, MG ×2 each), 3 medium (gun, rockets, gun) and 2 large
  (artillery emplacement, Patriot).
- **The AI's base** fills every open slot by the style's weights among towers of the slot's own
  size, and among smaller ones only when the style has none of that size. So a base mixes all three
  sizes. Anti-air is always in it (the last small slot turns into one). Styles for the generals:
  - Varga: anti-tank towers;
  - Orlov: artillery emplacements;
  - Kessler: an even spread;
  - Dr Sen: drone hangars;
  - Quạ Đen: anti-air;
  - Aurel: the strongest of everything.

## 3. Towers: cards, branches

- **Tower cards** use the card ranks (1–10, +5 % a rank) and blueprints like vehicles. A loadout
  tower now carries its card's rank; other fixed defences (a fortress, a point's watchtower) still
  do not, unless the side boosts everything.
- **Branches are defs that inherit their tower** (`"inherits"`, `"branchOf"` in balance.json): the
  tower's data with the branch's changes on top, its model too. From rank 7 a tower card picks one
  of its two branches. The first pick is free and a change costs 800 coins. The loadout carries the
  pick into battle (`BaseLoadout.Branches`), and the tower is raised as its branch in its own slot.
  A branch shows as "tower · branch" (`branch.<id>` texts).

## 3F. Base loadout screen

- **Where it lives.** A third view of the Army tab (Deck | Equipment | Base, vi "Căn cứ"), next to the
  deck and equipment screens, because the base is the other loadout a battle takes. Device checks:
  `-mb-base` opens it; `-mb-base-map=<map>`, `-mb-base-gear` (Gear tab), `-mb-base-pick=<tower>` (a
  tower armed, its slots lit) and `-mb-base-confirm` (the branch-change question) go with it;
  `-mb-en` / `-mb-vi` force a language.
- **Layout.** Top: HQ level 1–5 (all open for now) with what the level opens, the map picker and Save.
  Left: the tower cards (size icon, rank, branch, how many are placed). Middle: the camp, under a
  legend that counts filled/open slots per size (so there is no fortification points bar), a "front"
  marker and a hint for what to do next. Right: the picked tower card with Branch and Gear tabs (and
  Take out when a filled slot is picked), then the outpost's two slots. The right column is a quarter of
  the width (320–420 px), so the camp gets what is left on 16:9 and gains on wider phones.
- **The camp diagram** is drawn from the map's conquest data for team 0, turned so the camp's front
  (the HQ's heading, towards the enemy) points up. All camps face north-east, so this matches the
  battle camera and the minimap. The grid, the map's roads and edge, and a tick for each tower's facing
  are drawn under the frames; frames are opaque so the roads never show through them.
- **Frames are not to scale.** A hardpoint is 5–9 m across, a few pixels on the diagram, so frames get a
  size per class (small 72, medium 84, large 96, HQ 86 px) that is still a finger target, 1 px borders for
  small and 2 px for the others, and the size icon in the corner. Where two frames would overlap they are
  pushed apart (a relaxation, then the smallest frame in the way moves to the nearest free spot), so the
  diagram keeps the camp's shape without frames on top of each other. `BaseScreenTests` checks every map
  at the 16:9 and the wide panel size.
- **Size icons.** The same corner brackets for all three sizes with a footprint square inside that grows
  (`slot_small`, `slot_medium`, `slot_large`), plus `hq` and `module` (utility), 24-unit stroke SVG.
- **Placing.** Drag a tower onto a slot, or tap a tower and then a slot, or tap a slot and then a tower.
  While a tower is carried only the open slots it fits light up (bone); the one under the finger turns
  green; the rest go dark. Dropping replaces what was there. A placed tower is dragged to another slot (a
  swap when both fit, otherwise its old slot is left empty) or back onto the tower list to take it out; a
  picked slot also shows Take out. In the list a mostly vertical pull scrolls and a sideways pull
  (towards the camp) starts a drag, so the list stays scrollable on touch.
- **Empty slots stay empty.** A loadout list may now hold an empty entry (`BaseLoadout.Empty`), kept by
  `Fitted` and skipped by `BaseSystem.Establish`, so emptying the second small slot does not move the
  third small tower into it. A tower that does not fit is still dropped as before (`HqLevelsOpenSizedSlots`).
- **The rules are in the Sim** (`BaseLayout`): which place each hardpoint reads (the i-th of its size,
  as the battle raises them; `BaseLayoutTests` compares it with `Establish` on every map), what fits,
  place, clear, move, and the layout that is saved.
- **Closed slots** (beyond the HQ level) are greyed with the level that opens them and keep their towers
  (shown dim): the saved layout is cut to the top level's slots, not the chosen level's, so lowering the
  HQ level and raising it again loses nothing. Closed slots are not drop targets.
- **Utility slots** are hatched "soon" slots while the catalog has no utility module. Once modules exist
  (the tower roster adds them) they are listed under Utility and only they light the utility slots up;
  the screen needs no change for that.
- **Outpost.** Its two places (small, then medium, the order of `BaseLoadout.Outpost`) are drop targets
  like the camp's but are never emptied: an outpost always flies in with two towers, so they are
  replaced, not cleared. An invalid saved outpost falls back to guard tower + gun turret.
- **Saving.** Save is the screen's one amber action; it writes `BaseLayout.ForSaving` (lists cut to the
  top level, what does not fit becomes a gap, trailing gaps dropped) through `PlayerProfile.BaseLoadout`.
  Leaving the view (another view, tab or page) saves too, so nothing is lost. The profile now remembers
  that the base was edited (`baseEdited`), so a camp cleared on purpose does not come back as the
  default loadout.
- **Branch choice** is on the picked tower card: its branches with name and info; locked below rank 7
  (with the rank to reach); the first pick is free and applies at once; a change asks first (the price
  in the question) and spends `PlayerProfile.BranchSwapCoins`. Only the AA turret has branches on this
  branch; the others say so.
- **Gear tab.** Weapon, Structure and Systems for the tower type. `PlayerProfile.TowerGear` is empty on
  this branch, so the slots show empty with a note. The one connection point is
  `BaseScreen.TowerGearIn(towerId, slot)`. The tower equipment API (feature/visual-overhaul) was not
  merged here: the merge was refused by the permission system, so the connection is left to the merge
  (see the hand-off note).
- **Style.** Field Command: graphite surfaces, hairlines, square corners. Amber only for Save and the
  chosen tab or level; lit slots in bone, the drop target in green. Every colour and size is in the
  stylesheet (`--base-*` and `--camp-*` properties; the diagram reads its colours from them); C# sets
  only positions. Tap targets are at least 72 px and text wraps instead of being cut with an ellipsis,
  as the coming Field Command 2.0 rules ask.
- **Tower icons.** `CardIcons.For` now has icons for the tower cards (a branch takes its tower's), which
  used to fall back to the tank. The HQ guide text speaks of sized hardpoints, not fortification points.
